        This read was interesting to see someone look at their making process with such a keen and analytical observation. I think many of us have similar feelings about making. I especially identified with the part where she talked about her feeling that <b><em>if she were to analyze and interpret her dances that they would lose some of  their magical qualities.</em></b> It's sort of a cop out however. She seems to come to this conclusion as well. It's a shield that artistic types use to keep themselves from criticism. They leave the art up to the interpretation of the viewer instead of telling the viewer what the art is. In this way the artist is safe from being ridiculed because the art is just art, it has no meaning but what we put on it. Not to mention that intention through art is difficult. Intention puts guard rails up where once there was open field. To an artist this can seem restrictive but it can also be helpful in producing something with more impact, something longer lasting.

        Another thing I found interesting was how reflective her work became once she had identified a place she wanted to improve. She looked at old videos of herself and noticed how her free form dances materialized and even noticed how she noticed her dancing. <b><em>How her noticing the dance effected her dancing afterwards.</em></b> She took a very inquisitive and almost scientific approach in analyzing her dances.

	    I thought it was interesting how she tried to take somewhat of a shortcut by trying to create a dance with parts of her other dances. She thought she could take parts of her more successful dances and make them into something new. I have been in similar situations with my art and have come to a similar conclusion.<b><em> This method of creating something “new” with pieces of old works feels fake and soulless.</em></b> Something manufactured instead of labored with love into the world with intention.

	    The main thrust of the writing seemed to me to say that creation, or “making”, as the author puts it is <b><em>a labor not only of love, but intention, iteration and rigor.</em></b> The best creation comes from a healthy mix of all of these elements. Not giving all the way to love where the piece is only raw emotion, not giving all the way into iteration where the piece becomes lost in the infinite possibilities, not too lost in intention that the piece lacks art, but somewhere in the middle.
