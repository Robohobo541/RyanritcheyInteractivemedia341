    I tripped on my shoelace<br>
    And I fell Up to the Roof tops,<br>
    Up over the town,<br>
    Up past the tree tops,<br>
    Up over the mountains,<br>
    Up where the colors<br>
    Blend into the sounds.<br>
    But it got me so dizzy<br>
    When I looked around,<br>
    I got sick to my stomach<br>
    And I threw down.<br>
