        <strong><em><h1>I tripped on my shoelace</h1> And I fell up -</em></strong> Up to the Roof tops,<strong> Up over the town,</strong> Up past the tree tops, Up over the mountains, Up where the colors Blend into the <strong>sounds.</strong> But it got me so dizzy When I looked around, I got sick to my stomach And I threw down.I tripped on my shoelace <h1>And I fell up </h1>- Up to the Roof tops, Up over the town, Up past the tree tops, Up over the mountains, Up where the colors Blend into the sounds. But it got me so dizzy When I looked around, I got sick to my stomach And I threw down.I tripped on my shoelace And I fell up - Up to the Roof tops, Up over the town, Up past the tree tops, Up over the mountains, Up where the colors Blend into the sounds.
