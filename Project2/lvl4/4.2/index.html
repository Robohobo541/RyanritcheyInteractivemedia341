        Falling Up</div>

        I tripped on my shoelace
        And I fell up -
        Up to the Roof tops,
        Up over the town,
        Up past the tree tops,
        Up over the mountains,
        Up where the colors
        Blend into the sounds.
        But it got me so dizzy
        When I looked around,
        I got sick to my stomach
        And I threw down.
        I tripped on my shoelace
        And I fell up -
        Up to the Roof tops,
        Up over the town,
        Up past the tree tops,
        Up over the mountains,
        Up where the colors
        Blend into the sounds.
        But it got me so dizzy
        When I looked around,
        I got sick to my stomach
        And I threw down. I tripped on my shoelace
        And I fell up -
        Up to the Roof tops,
        Up over the town,
        Up past the tree tops,
        Up over the mountains,
        Up where the colors
        Blend into the sounds.
        But it got me so dizzy
